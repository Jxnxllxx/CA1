# Starter Repository for Assignment
You are required to build your folder structures for your project.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure that the following dependencies are installed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Clone the Repository

1. Open Visual Studio Code (VSCode) on your local machine.

2. Click on the "Source Control" icon in the left sidebar (the icon looks like a branch).

3. Click on the "Clone Repository" button.

4. In the repository URL input field, enter `https://github.com/ST0503-BED/your-repository-name.git`.

5. Choose a local directory where you want to clone the repository.

6. Click on the "Clone" button to start the cloning process.

## Setting Up Environment Variables

This repository provides instructions for setting up environment variables using a `.env` file in an Express.js application. The environment variables will be used in the `db.js` file located in the `src/services` directory.

### Setup

To set up environment variables for your Express.js application, follow these steps:

1. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project.
2. Open the `.env` file and add the following lines:

   ```
   DB_HOST=<your_database_host>
   DB_USER=<your_database_user>
   DB_PASSWORD=<your_database_password>
   DB_DATABASE=<your_database_name>
   ```

   Replace `<your_database_host>`, `<your_database_user>`, `<your_database_password>`, and `<your_database_name>` with the appropriate values for your database connection.

   For example:

   ```
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=myuser
   DB_PASSWORD=mypassword
   DB_DATABASE=pokemon
   ```

   Note: Make sure there are no spaces around the equal sign (=) in each line.

3. Save the `.env` file.

### Usage

The `db.js` file in the `src/services` directory uses the `dotenv` package to read the `.env` file and set the environment variables. Here's an example of how the `db.js` file should look:

```javascript
require('dotenv').config(); // Read .env file and set environment variables

const mysql = require('mysql2');

const setting = {
    connectionLimit: 10, // Set limit to 10 connections
    host: process.env.DB_HOST, // Get host from environment variable
    user: process.env.DB_USER, // Get user from environment variable
    password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD, // Get password from environment variable
    database: process.env.DB_DATABASE, // Get database from environment variable
    multipleStatements: true, // Allow multiple SQL statements
    dateStrings: true // Return date as string instead of Date object
}

const pool = mysql.createPool(setting);

module.exports = pool;
```

The `dotenv` package is used to load the environment variables from the `.env` file, and `process.env` is used to access these variables in your code.

Make sure to include the `require('dotenv').config();` line at the beginning of your file to load the environment variables from the `.env` file.

## Important Note

Ensure that the `.env` file is included in your `.gitignore` file to prevent sensitive information (such as database credentials) from being exposed in your version control system.

That's it! You have successfully set up environment variables using a `.env` file in your Express.js application. These variables can now be accessed in the `db.js` file or any other part of your application where needed.

Now you can move on to next part below.

## Install Dependencies

1. Open the terminal in VSCode by going to `View` > `Terminal` or using the shortcut `Ctrl + ``.

2. Navigate to the project root directory.

3. Install the required dependencies using npm:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Database Initialization

1. Make sure you have a MySQL database available. Update the database configuration details in the `.env` file.

2. To initialize the database tables and populate them with sample data, open the terminal in VSCode and run the following command:

   ```
   npm run init_tables
   ```

## Commit and Sync Changes

1. Open the Source Control view in VSCode by clicking on the "Source Control" icon in the left sidebar.

2. Review the changes you made to the files.

3. Enter a commit message summarizing your changes in the input field at the top of the Source Control view.

4. Click on "Commit" to commit the changes.

5. Click on "Sync" to push your changes to the remote repository.

   Note: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to push changes to the repository.

## Submission

Once you have completed the practical and synchronized your changes, check the autograde of your submission.

**You may read the Test Cases below**

## New Test Cases

Below are additional new test cases on top of those similar to previous practical repository. Here's an overview of the test cases:

### Basic GET Routes

- `GET /users`:
  - Validates that the endpoint returns a 200 status code.
  - Checks the length of the response body array to ensure it matches the expected value.

- `GET /challenges`:
  - Validates that the endpoint returns a 200 status code.
  - Checks the length of the response body array to ensure it matches the expected value.

### Basic POST Routes

- `POST /users > No Body`:
  - Verifies that sending an empty body to the endpoint results in a 400 status code.

- `POST /users > With Body`:
  - Sends a valid request body to the endpoint and expects a 201 status code.

- `POST /challenges > With Body`:
  - Sends a valid request body to the endpoint and expects a 201 status code.

- `GET /users/:id > After POST`:
  - Retrieves the user with the specified ID and checks if the response matches the expected username and email.

- `GET /user > After POST > Check Length`:
  - Verifies that the length of the response array has increased after adding a new user.

### Basic PUT Routes

- `PUT /users/:id > User Not Exist`:
  - Attempts to update a user that does not exist and expects a 404 status code.

- `PUT /users/:id > User Exist`:
  - Updates an existing user and verifies that the response has a 204 status code.

- `PUT /challenges/:id > Challenge Not Exist`:
  - Attempts to update a user that does not exist and expects a 404 status code.

- `PUT /challengers/:id > Challenge Exist`:
  - Updates an existing user and verifies that the response has a 204 status code.
- `GET /user/:id > After PUT`:
  - Retrieves the user that was updated and checks if the response matches the updated username and email.

### Basic DELETE Routes

- `DELETE /challenges/:id`:
  - Deletes a challenge and expects a 204 status code.

- `GET /user/:id > After DELETE`:
  - Attempts to retrieve the deleted user and expects a 404 status code.

## Additional Information

- The tests assume the presence of a MySQL database and use the `mysql2` package for database interactions. Make sure to configure the database connection details in your Express.js application.
- The tests also assume the usage of the `pool` object from `src/services/db.js` for database operations.
